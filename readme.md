   ###  Relation Recurrent Attentive Neural Network (RRAN) for Small Object Detection
   ===
*I proposed a new Relation Recurrent Attentive Neural Network(RRAN) for Small Object Detection during my internship at DLLab in NIO.  
*It processes a set of objects simultaneously through interaction between their appearance feature and geometry, thus relations could be modelled. Futher I used a novel recurrent attentive neural network to improve the detection accuracy in a fine-grained manner.  
*Experimental result shows that our methods achieved better performance than several popular methods widely used in object detection.  
*My work is temporarily confidential.
